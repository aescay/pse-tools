# PSE Tools (pse-tools)
A collection of useful Python scripts involving the Philippine Stock Exchange.

## Scripts
The list of scripts included in this collection are as follows:

### pse-quotes.py
Python Script which retrieves PSE stock quotes from the Open PSE Initiative.
See http://openpse.com/ for more information.

#### Usage
The pse-quotes.py script is invoked in the following manner:
```
    pse-quotes.py --stocks <stocks> --from <yyyy-mm-dd> --to <yyyy-mm-dd>
```
It can also be invoked in the following manner:
```
    pse-quotes.py -s <stocks> -f <yyyy-mm-dd> -t <yyyy-mm-dd>
```

#### Arguments
The pse-quotes.py script takes in the following Command-Line arguments:
```
    stocks: optional, string, default=None
        The symbols of the stocks to retrieve, separated by commas.
        Simply not providing this option will mean that all stocks are to be selected.
    start: optional, string, default='1900-01-01'
        Retrieve quotes beginning from this date.
        This date should be in yyyy-mm-dd format.
    end: optional, string, default=datetime.date.today()
        Retrieve quotes up until this date.
        This date should be in yyyy-mm-dd format.
```

#### Input
The pse-quotes.py script does not read anything from Standard Input.
    
#### Output
The pse-quotes.py script dumps the following onto the Standard Output upon completion:
```
    [
        {
            "name": "<stock-name>",
            "price_close": "<closing-price>",
            "price_high": "<high-price>",
            "price_low": "<low-price>",
            "price_open": "<opening-price>",
            "quote_date": "<yyyy-mm-dd>",
            "symbol": "<stock-symbol>",
            "volume": <trade-volume>
        }
    ]
```
If the script fails, nothing is dumped onto the Standard Output.
